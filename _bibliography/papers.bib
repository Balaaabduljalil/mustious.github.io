  title={CONFERENCE: Leveraging Closed-Access Multilingual Embedding for Automatic Sentence Alignment in Low Resource Languages.},

  abstract={The importance of qualitative parallel data in machine translation has long been determine but it has always very difficult to obtain such in sufficient quantity for the majority of world languages, mainly because 
  of the associated cost and also the lack of accessibility to these languages. Despite the potential for obtaining parallel datasets from online articles using automatic approaches, forensic investigations have found a lot of quality-related
  issues such as misalignment, and wrong language codes. In this work, we present a simple but qualitative parallel sentence aligner that carefully leveraged a closed-access Cohere multilingual embedding. The proposed approach achieved 
  94.96 and 54.83 F1 scores on FLORES and MAFAND-MT, compared to 3.64 and 0.64 of LASER respectively. Our method also achieved an improvement of more than 5 BLEU scores over LASER, when the resulting datasets were used with MAFAND-MT dataset to 
  train a translation model. Our code and data are available for research purposes.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
