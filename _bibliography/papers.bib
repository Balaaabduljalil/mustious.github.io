  title={POSTER: An Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIOT) based Assistive Smart Glass for the Visually Impaired},
  author={Mustapha, A.},
  abstract={The blind and visually impaired constantly face challenges interacting with the society and performing common tasks. This project aims to develop a
functional and cost-effective assistive device to aid the blind and visually impaired improve their quality of life as well as independence. The AIOT
Smart Glass (SG) consists of a camera module to capture images and feeds them to the raspberry pi for analysis such as screen description, object
recognition, reading printed text, etc. The AIOT smart glass is controlled easily using the Respeaker 2-Mics Pi Hat for voice commands or button taps
which is directly integrated with a conversational chatbot for seamless usage. It has an additional feature of facial recognition; assisting users to
recognize the faces of their families and other close members. The output of the system is passed as audio response through an earphone to the
user. Results shows that the AIOT smart glass take an average of about 5 secs to responds to query in the presence of good internet availability.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
